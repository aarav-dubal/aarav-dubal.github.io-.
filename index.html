                <h3>NFL Injury Risk Assessment</h3>
                <p>I created this project as a way for football fans to easily find the injury risks
                    for their favorite players. The main features of my project are the dropdown menus
                    with data filters to easily search for a player, and then the table that is generated once the
                    parameters for searching a player are met. The table includes the player's name, 
                    season injury risk, and their team. To incoroporate the data into my code, I used 
                    data from the DraftSharks Injury Guide and manually added almost every player in the 
                    database into the code. I then had to translate the data from Python into JavaScript 
                    in order to make it connect to the front end.</p>

                    certain filters are given, which are Indianapolis quarterbacks in this case." width=600>
                <p>When I first started working on this project, I had to take some time to learn about data structures in
                    Python and JavaScript so I knew how to store the data. Once I found the data, I started to manually import it into multiple data structures in JS, one for each position group. As I started to work on the front end and the technicality of the project, a common issue that I ran into was that the generate button would not print out the data searched for in the front end. This issue persisted for a few weeks, but proofreading the code and some help from ChatGPT helped me resolve the issue.</p>
